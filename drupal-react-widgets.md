#Bluecadet
![fit](media/bc.jpg)

^ Established in 2007, Bluecadet is an Emmy Award-winning digital agency that creates world-class websites, mobile apps, interactive installations, and immersive environments. We collaborate with leading museums, cultural institutions, universities, progressive brands, and nonprofit organizations to educate, engage, and entertain.

^ Bluecadet is an experience design agency. We partner with mission-driven organizations to create a broad suite of products and environments. We embrace design, technology, and innovation in the service of content, emotion, and experience. We create experiences that engage audiences through increased knowledge, empathy, and action.

^ We don't consider ourselves a Drupal shop. We do want to use the right tool for the right job. That said, we do use Drupal, and the "other" CMS for most of our BE needs. We are slated this year to really epxplore other CMSs, but my gut is telling our websites will stay inthe Drupal sphere for quite awhile.
