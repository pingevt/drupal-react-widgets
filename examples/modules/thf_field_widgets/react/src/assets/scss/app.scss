// ----
// ITCSS Overview
//
// The CSS for this project is organized according to the ITCSS methodology.
// The principles of ITCSS organize file structure to guide specificity in a
// downward flow, from wide-reaching to very specific.
//
// ITCSS ORGANIZATION:
//   01_Settings......Variables that are public to the project
//   02_Mixins........Mixins and functions that are public to the project
//   03_Generic.......High-level, far reaching styles. Ex: reset.scss, *, html, etc.
//   04_Utilities.....Classes with very specific purposes. They are useful for reuse but
//                      specific and succinct in their implementation. Ex: cover, caps, etc.
//
// Component SCSS files live alongside the JSX file
//
// CLASS NAMING CONVENTIONS:
// Classes are implemented in a BEM (Block/Element/Modifier) structure, and prepended with
// their ITCSS type. This means that `components` are prepended with `c-`
